            <p> If you are not already a continuing UH Mānoa student, you must first apply for admission by the
                appropriate deadline and be admitted. Visit Admissions for more information.

                If you have never received VA education benefits and have not yet applied for benefits with the
                Department of Veterans Affairs, visit VA.gov to apply.

                If you have received VA education benefits from another school, but have never received benefits from UH
                Mānoa, visit VA.gov to apply for a Change of Program or Place of Training and to update your current
                benefits.

        </div>
        <div class="ui bottom attached tab segment" data-tab="second">
            <p>If the VA approves your application, you will receive a Certificate of Eligibility (COE), or award
                letter, in the mail. You must provide a copy of your COE to the Office of the Registrar in-person or
                scan and email your COE to uhmva@hawaii.edu.

                Note: If you have not yet received a COE from the VA, but would like to start your benefits, provide a
                copy of the confirmation page of your VA application. You may also provide your statement of benefits
                from the VA website.

                Note: Students under the CH 31 Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment benefit do not receive a COE. Your
                case manager should send a VA Form 28-1905 directly to <a href="mailto:uhmva@hawaii.edu">uhmva@hawaii.edu</a>

        <div class="ui bottom attached tab segment" data-tab="third">
            <p>It is your responsibility to see that UH Mānoa evaluates transcripts from previous institutions attended
                to determine the number of transferable credits that will be counted toward your degree. The VA mandates
                that all transcripts be evaluated by UH Mānoa for prior credit, including transcripts for military
                training, even if credit may not be granted. Failure to do so could lead to suspension of benefits. All
                official transcripts must be sent directly from the prior institution to the appropriate UH Mānoa
                Admissions Office.

                Visit How to Request Your Military Transcripts [PDF] for instructions on how to request and send your
                military transcripts to the university.</p>
